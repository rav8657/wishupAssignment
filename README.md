## WishUp Assignment
### Overview
- This project is about creating the primary REST service for a **Subscription as a Service** startup. My REST service will be used by companies that will define subscriptions plans to which the users of the platform can subscribe to.
- This assignment consists of 4 APIs :
  - 2 for User registration and fetch user details.
  - 2 for subscriptions - Purchase subscription and fetch by user_name.
- Created a branch named `WishUp/Assignment` and followed proper naming convention in order to convey my work efficiently.
## Models
- User Model
```JavaScript
{
    user_name : {type: String, required: Name is mandatory, trim: true, unique: true},
    created_at : {type: Date}
}
```
- Subscription Model
```JavaScript
{
    user_name : {type: String, required: Name is mandatory, trim: true, unique: true},
    plan_id : {type: String, required: Subscription plan is mandatory, trim: true},
    start_date : {type: String}
}
```
## API Services

### POST /subscription
- This is the primary API being tested in this assignment.
- Register a new subscription for an existing user, with a specified plan and start date.

    ```yaml
    {
        status : "Success",
        amount : "-200.0"
    }

- On success, return 200 HTTP status code. For failures, pick an appropriate status code for it.
